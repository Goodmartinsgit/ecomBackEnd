*****BACKEND INSTALLATION AND SETUP***


//**DATABASE SETUP
1***Install pgAdmin and Create a Database

    Download and install pgAdmin and PostgreSQL.  

    Create a new local database (e.g., ecome_db).  

    Note your database credentials (user, password, port, and database name). 
    We used hosted NeonDb
     


2***Install Prisma and Prisma Client

    Run npm install prisma --save-dev  

    Run npm install @prisma/client  

    Initialize Prisma in your project using:  

    npx prisma init (This will create a prisma folder with a schema.prisma file and an .env file.)  


3***Configure Database Connection

    In your .env file, set your PostgreSQL connection string:  

    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/ecome_db?schema=public"  


4***Define Your Schema

    Open prisma/schema.prisma and define your models (e.g., User, Product, Category).  

    Before defining models, add this generator block at the top of your schema file:  

    generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
    previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
    output = "node_modules/.prisma/client"
    }

    Explanation:  
    This generator block tells Prisma how and where to create the Prisma Client — which is the tool your backend will use to    interact with your database.  
    - provider = "prisma-client-js" means Prisma will generate a JavaScript client for your Node.js project.  
    - previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"] enables Prisma’s latest client extensions feature, giving you access to new    capabilities and future enhancements.  
    - output = "node_modules/.prisma/client" specifies the path where the Prisma Client files will be generated.  
    This is the recommended default location for Prisma v6, ensuring that your project can easily import the client using:  
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"  

    Without this generator section, Prisma would not know how to create or locate the Prisma Client, and your backend would be  unable to query the database.  


    Example:  

    model User {
    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    name      String
    email     String   @unique
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    }  

5***Run Database Migration

    Use Prisma Migrate to create and apply your schema:  

    npx prisma migrate dev --name init  


6***Generate Prisma Client

    Prisma Client allows your backend to interact with the database:  

    npx prisma generate  


7***Test the Connection

    You can test by running:  

    npx prisma studio  

T   his opens a local database GUI to verify your data models.




//*EXPRESS SETUP

tags, size, colors []
1***Packages Installation: install express, nodemon, dotenv

    npm install express dotenv
    npm install --save-dev nodemon


    express → framework for building your server and APIs.

    dotenv → loads environment variables from .env file.

    nodemon → automatically restarts your server during development when files change.
// index.js

// *** STEP 1: Import required packages ***

// Import Express framework
const express = require("express");

// Import dotenv to load environment variables from .env file
const dotenv = require("dotenv");



// *** STEP 2: Configure dotenv ***

// This line loads all variables from the .env file into process.env
dotenv.config();



// *** STEP 3: Initialize the Express app ***

// Create an instance of an Express application
const app = express();



// *** STEP 4: Middleware setup ***

// express.json() is a built-in middleware that parses incoming JSON requests. It makes the body of POST/PUT requests available in req.body 




// express.urlencoded()) Parse form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)





// *** STEP 5: Define the port from .env or default to 5000
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Start the server and listen on the defined port
// This is where your server "lives" — it begins accepting requests here.
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(✅ Server is running and listening on port ${PORT});
});



*****Registering User

****Controller
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

    1. destructure all feilds from req.body
    2. chaek if all feilsds are being passed
    3. Validate email using  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    4. Validate password****
        *Install bcrypt and use it in hasing the password by salting and hasing
    5. Handle image upload using cloudinary**** 
        *install cloudinaryv2()
            npm install cloudinary
        *set up cloudinary
        *install multer and setup multer. ()
            npm install multer
        *setup multer
            Notes / clarifications:

            memoryStorage() keeps files in RAM as buffers. It does not push them to the database directly—you still need to handle that in your route/controller.

            uploads is the Multer middleware, which you attach to routes to parse incoming file uploads (req.file for single, req.files for multiple).
